1. 
2. `toJSON` method
	-	serialize hash
	-	retain keys
	-	option to restrict to lists > 1
3. `fromJSON`
	-	validate input JSON
		-	keys are alphagrams
		-	values are unique string arrays
4. `copy` method
	-	return a new anagram hash
5. `delete`/`remove` method
	-	any performance concerns here?
	-	is this needed? only if want to use hash as a complete data store, rather than as a means to determine anagrams.
